# Phase plane plotter project

The purpose of this project is to quickly and easily plot phase planes for linear systems of two dimensional equations. This repository could be generalised to multiple dimensions quite easily but for the purposes of visualisation I've kept it strictly in the 2D realm.

The `phase_space.ipynb` file contians all the maths that went into this, the `interactive_lienar_phase_portrait.py` file contains a cool interactive plot in which you can plot any phase portrait you'd like by inputting a suitable matrix, when the plot is clicked on, a trajectory will form from that point and be marked on the diagram.

## Example use

```
python interactive_linear_phase_portrait.py
```
